          The Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that was bred to
          retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during
          hunting and shooting parties.The name "retriever" refers to the
          breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft
          mouth.
